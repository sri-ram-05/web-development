### Project Description

This project is a simple web application that integrates Flask with MongoDB, focusing on user authentication and interaction. It was a valuable learning experience as it provided insights into how different components of a web application work together. Despite its simplicity, the project helped me understand the fundamental principles of web development and database integration.

### Project Structure and File Summary

1. **`flask/` (Main Directory)**:
   - **`__pycache__/`**: This folder contains compiled Python files (`.pyc`) created automatically by Python for optimization purposes.
   - **`controller/`**: This folder holds the controller files that handle the business logic of the application.
     - **`signin.py`**: Contains the `signin_controller` function that handles user registration. It checks if the email and username are unique before inserting the user data into MongoDB.
     - **`login.py`**: Contains the `login_controller` function that manages user login. It verifies the user's credentials by checking the username and password against the data stored in MongoDB.
   - **`templates/`**: This folder holds the HTML templates used to render the web pages.
     - **`dashboard.html`**: Displays a message indicating that user data has been successfully inserted. It is designed to be more user-friendly with improved styling and layout.
     - **`login.html`**: Contains the login form for users to input their username and password. It now includes a "Sign Up" button that redirects users to the registration page if they donâ€™t have an account.
     - **`signin.html`**: Contains the registration form where users can sign up with their name, username, password, and email. It also provides feedback on errors if the registration fails.
   - **`__init__.py`**: Sets up the Flask application and defines the routes for the web application. It includes routes for the home page, login page, registration page, and dashboard. It uses the `signin_controller` to handle user registration and redirects to the dashboard upon successful registration.
   - **`db.py`**: Contains the `databaseInit` function that initializes the connection to the MongoDB database. It loads the MongoDB URI from the `.env` file and returns the database connection object.
   - **`test.py`**: Used for testing the MongoDB connection. It connects to the MongoDB server, creates a database and collection, and inserts a sample document to verify that MongoDB is working properly.

### Learning Experience

Through this project, I gained practical experience in the following areas:
- **Flask Framework**: Understanding how Flask handles routing and rendering templates.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Learning how to connect to a MongoDB database, perform CRUD operations, and manage database connections.
- **Web Forms and User Authentication**: Implementing user registration and login functionality using web forms and backend validation.
- **File Organization and Structure**: Organizing a project with multiple components and understanding the role of each file in the overall application.

Overall, while the project is simple, it provided a solid foundation in web development and database management. It was an excellent opportunity to learn how various technologies and components interact within a web application.
